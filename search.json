    "text": "Accessing Derived data\nMost of the derived data is in NOLANLABDATASTORE/ActiveProjects/Wolf/COHORT12/. The Sorting Analyzer are kept in NOLANLABDATASTORE/ActiveProjects/Chris/Cohort12/derivatives.\nAll of this data is synchronized.\n\nFolder structure\nEach mouse day (usually) corresponds to one “experiment”, which might contain several “sessions”. To reflect this, the derived data is organised as follows:\nderivatives_folder/\n    M{mouse}/\n        D{day}/\n            full/\n            {session_type_1}/\n            {session_type_2}/\n            ...\nThe information in full is shared between all sessions in the experiment (e.g. if all the data is sorted together, the sorted data is stored here) while information unique to each session is stored in the session_type_n folder. This folder can contain many pieces of data. The data is described below.\n\n\nSpike data\nStored at\n/ActiveProjects/Wolf/COHORT12/M{mouse}/D{day}/{session}/sub-{mouse}_day-{day}_ses-{session}_srt-{sorter_protocol}_clusters.npz\nContains sorted (but non-curated) clusters. Most importantly each cluster contains a spike train, giving timepoints for each spike in that cluster in seconds. The file is an npz file which can be read using numpy. However, we recommend using pyanpple to open them. The following code snippets loads a file and bins its spike train:\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport pynapple as nap\n\nmouse = 25\nday = 25\nsession = \"OF1\"\nsrt = \"kilosort4\"\n\npath_to_active_project = Path(\"/Volumes/cmvm/sbms/groups/CDBS_SIDB_storage/NolanLab/ActiveProjects/\")\nsession_folder = path_to_active_project / f\"Wolf/COHORT12/M{mouse}/D{day}/{session}/\"\nclusters_file = session_folder / f\"sub-{mouse}_day-{day}_ses-{session}_srt-{srt}_clusters.npz\"\n\nclusters = nap.load_file(clusters_file)\n\n# print the time stamps of cluster 19\nprint(clusters[19])\nWe also store metadata. All the metadata can be accessed through clusters.metadata. This includes:\nQuality metrics of each cluster, taken from the SortingAnalyzer, which can be used to curate:\n# Find all clusters with a firing rate greater than 10, then subselect using these\nhigh_firing_clusters = clusters[clusters['firing_rate'] &gt; 10]\n\n# Print how many clusters there are with a high firing rate\nprint(len(high_firing_clusters))\nAnatomical information for each cluster. This is the estimate position of the cluster in the brain. We can access the stereotaxic coordinds, common coordinate framework or the estimated brain region as follows:\n# print the brain region of cluster 6:\nclusters['brain_region'][6]\n\n# print the CCF coords of cluster 12:\nCCFs = clusters[['coord_CCFs_z', 'coord_CCFs_y', 'coord_CCFs_x']]\nprint(CCFs.iloc[12])\n\n# print the SC coords of cluster 16:\nSCs = clusters[['coord_SCs_x','coord_SCs_y','coord_SCs_z']]\nprint(SCs.iloc[16])\n\n\nBehavioural Data\nStored at\n/ActiveProjects/Wolf/COHORT12/M{mouse}/D{day}/{session}/sub-{mouse}_day-{day}_ses-{session}_srt-{sorter_protocol}_beh.nwb\nThese are NeurodataWithoutBorder files. Can be read with the pynwb or matnwb packages, but we recommend using pynapple. The behavioural data stored depends on the session\nRegardless of session type, they are loaded the same way, and we can investigate what is saved in them as follow:\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport pynapple as nap\n\nmouse = 25\nday = 25\nsession = \"OF1\"\n\npath_to_active_project = Path(\"/Volumes/cmvm/sbms/groups/CDBS_SIDB_storage/NolanLab/ActiveProjects/\")\nsession_folder = path_to_active_project / f\"Wolf/COHORT12/M{mouse}/D{day}/{session}/\"\nbeh_file = session_folder / f\"sub-{mouse}_day-{day}_ses-{session}_beh.nwb\"\n\nbeh = nap.load_file(beh_file)\n\n# see what is saved\nprint(beh)\nWe’ll discuss the most important data that we save below:\n\nOF behavioural data\n\nP_x and P_y. Time series of position in cartesian coordinates, in units of cm.\nS. Time series of computed speed of mouse, in cm/s.\nmoving. Interval set of whether or not the mouse is moving, with threshold ?? (WOLF).\n\n\n\nVR behavioural data\n\nP. Time series of position along the VR track, in units of cm.\nS. Time series of computed speed along the VR track, in units of cm.\nmoving. Interval set of whether of not the mouse is moving.\nlick. Time series of when the mouse licks.\neye_dilation. Time series of pupil dilation, in dimensionless units.\ntrials. Interval set of trails. Used to pick out individual trails.\ntrial_type. Time series of which trial type is active at any time point. Type 0 is uncued and type 1 is cued.\n\n\n\nExample code\nWe use pynapple to combine behavioral and spiking data. For example, to compute the most basic positional turning curve in VR we can run\nbeh = nap.load_file(beh_file)\nclusters = nap.load_file(clusters_file)\n\npositional_tuning_curves = nap.compute_1d_tuning_curves(\n    group=clusters,\n    feature=beh['P'],\n    nb_bins=50,\n)\nwhich we can plot…\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ncluster_id = 4\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(positional_tuning_curves[cluster_id])\nax.set_xlabel(\"Position along track\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Firing rate (Hz)\")\nfig.savefig(\"positional_tuning_curve_cluster_{cluster_id}.pdf\")\nThe real power of pynapple is dealing with time sub-selection using the epoch concept (read more).\nIn the following code we compute a 1D tuning curve only when the mouse is moving and only during cued trails:\nbeaconed_trials = beh['trials'][beh['trials']['type'] == 'b']\nmoving_and_beaconed = beh['moving'].intersect(beaconed_trials)\n\npositional_tuning_curves = nap.compute_1d_tuning_curves(\n    group=clusters,\n    feature=beh['P'],\n    nb_bins=50,\n    ep=moving_and_beaconed,\n)\n\n\n\nSortingAnalyzer\nStored at\n/ActiveProjects/Chris/Cohort12/derivatives\nA spikeinterface SortingAnalyzer object, containing spike times and dervied information such as unit templates, spike locations etc. The analyzer depends on the sorter used. We label each sorting protocol by a number. The details of the protocols can be found in the Protocols section.\nCan be read using spikeinterface\nimport spikeinterface.full as si\nsa_path = \"derivatives/M25/D20/full/kilosort4/kilosort4_sa\"\nsorting_analyzer = si.read_sorting_analyzer(sa_path)\nUsed for more intricate curation and for comparisons of different spike sorters. Our default sorting is the protocol kilosort4.\nRead more about SortingAnalyzers here, here and here (video)."

We manually labelled the pixel location for features of interest from raw video data. We then trained bespoke deeplabcut models to infer pixel positions for each video in the dataset.\nOpen field videos captured the mouse’s movement in the square arena with a birds eye view. We estimated the mouse’s pose using five features including head, shoulders, middle, tail start and tail end. Pixel coordinates coordinates were transformed and scaled to match the 1 m x 1 m dimensions of the open arena. To estimate head direction, we took the vector between the head and middle features and calculated an angle relative to north.\nAdd image or gif?\nVirtual reality videos captured a side view of the mouse while head-restraint on a cylindrical treadmill. We estimated the mouse’s pupil diameter using eight features including eye north, eye north-east, eye-east etc. Pupil diamter was defined as the average pixel distance between opposite features such as north vs south, north-east vs south-west etc. Units for pupil diameter are arbitrarily defined as we were only concerned with relative changes.\nadd image or gif of pupil models\nWe estimated when the mouse’s was engaged in licking using a single feature marking the position of the tongue. When the tongue was out of sight (in the mouse’s mouth), we marked the tongue’s position as the bottom of the mouth. Plotting the tongues position across a session typically produced a point cloud with two clearly defined clusters. To label positions attributable to lick events, we manually drew around the lower positioned cluster. Finally we visually verified this method by creating gif snippets for each session and accessing whether licks were labelled accurately.\n  \nadd image or gif of lick models"

    "section": "FAQ",
    "text": "FAQ\nHow was the experiment conducted on a typical day?\nExperimental days involved recording from mice in the open arena and then in the virtual location memory task and then once again in the open arena. Mice were collected from the holding room 30 - 60 minutes before recording, were handled for 5 - 10 minutes, weighed and placed for 10 - 20 minutes in a cage containing objects and a running wheel. Between recording sessions mice were placed back in the object-filled playground for 10 - 20 minutes. The open arena consisted of a metal box with a square floor area, removable metal walls, metal frame (Frame parts from Kanya UK, C01-1, C20-10, A33-12, B49-75, B48-75, A39-31, ALU3), and an A4-sized cue card in the middle of one of the metal walls. For the open field exploration session, mice were placed in the open arena while tethered via an ultrathin Neuropixel aquisition cable No Commutator was used. In a small number of sessions, tangling of the Neuropixel cable caused the cable to fall in front of the mouse. To stop mice from knawing on the cable, Mice were quickly untangled by the experimentor. For the location memory task water-restricted mice were trained to obtain rewards at a location on the virtual linear track. Mice were head-fixed using a RIVETS clamp (Ronal Tool Company, Inc) and ran on a cylindrical treadmill fitted with a rotary encoder (Pewatron). Virtual tracks, generated using Blender3D (blender.com) had length 200 cm, with a 60 cm track zone, a 20 cm reward zone, a second 60 cm track zone and a 60 cm black box to separate successive trials. The distance visible ahead of the mouse was 50 cm. The reward zone was either marked by distinct vertical green and black bars on beaconed trials, or was not marked by a visual cue at all on non-beaconed. A feeding tube placed in front of the animal dispensed 10 % sucrose water rewards (5 - 10 5l per reward) if the mouse stopped in the reward zone. A stop was registered in Blender3D if the speed of the mouse dropped below 3 cm/s. Speed was calculated on a rolling basis from the previous 100 ms at a rate of 60 Hz. Trials were delivered in a random fashion with a equal probability on any given trial of being beaconed or non-beaconed. Mice were trained to an expert level in the location memory task before being implanted with Neuropixel 2.0 probes and undergoing the three session (open arena/location memory task/open arena) For more details, see Clark and Nolan 2024, https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.89356.2\nHow was data collected?\nElectrophysiological signals were acquired using a Neuropixel 2.0 headstage connected via an Neuropixel aquisition cable attached to an IMEC-National Instruments aquisition system (recommended hardware as of July 2024). For the location memory task, positional and trial information was saved in Blender3D at 60 Hz and time sync with TTL pulses delivered concurrently to the Neuropixel aquisition system and the Blender3D computer via an arduino Due. In the open arena, motion and head-direction tracking used a camera (Logitech B525, 1280 x 720 pixels Webcam, RS components 795-0876) attached to the celing of the frame. A custom bonsai tracking script picked up the TTL pulses delivered to an LED in sight of the tracking camera and out of sight of the freely exploring mouse. Body and head direction tracking was completed post-recording using DeepLabCut.\nWhat was the surgery schedule of the experiment?\nMice underwent two seperate surgeries under anaesthesia, the first being a headpost attachment surgery followed by a Neuropixel 2.0 implantation mounted on a Apollo drive resuable 3D printed body. All surgeries were performed by Harry Clark\nWhat drugs were used in the experiment?\nIsoflurane used during surgery. Vetergesic jelly given post surgery. Carprofen and Buprenorphine were given subcutaneously at the recommended dosage post surgery\nHow can I reproduce the stereotaxic surgery?\nAdd this\nWhere can I find files for 3D printing the reusable 3D printed components?\nAdd this Include rivets custom designs\nWhere can I find the used NP2 probes for use in future experiments?\nThere are currently 4 x NP2 4-shank probes ready to be used for implantation. These can be found within the 2nd floor wet lab room (add room number) in the drive building area. A box labelled with “Neuropixel 2.0 4 shank probes, Harry Clark” can be found on the shelf above the drive building bench in the drive staging area (marked by yellow tape). (This information was accurate as of 04/03/2025). These drives are super-glued to an Apollo drive shuttle and thus can only be used for further experimentation with Apollo drive compatible components.\nStill missing a vital piece of information?\nEmail harrydclark91@gmail.com for further clarification so we can add the relevant information to this document."
